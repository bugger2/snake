# Making moves in quick succession is difficult

It is particularly difficult to perform two movements right after each other, since I limited it to one key per frame

Thinking maybe we have an array of 2 or 3 directions to change to, and the first element gets set in the soonest frame, all the other directions get moved forward in the array, and whenever the user pushes a button, the corresponding direction gets sent to the end of the array
